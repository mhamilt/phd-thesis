	abstract = {When designing digital musical instruments the importance of low and consistent action-to-sound latency is widely accepted. This paper investigates the effects of latency (0-20ms) on instrument quality evaluation and performer interaction. We present findings from an experiment conducted with musicians who performed on an percussive digital musical instrument with variable amounts of latency. Three latency conditions were tested against a zero latency condition, 10ms, 20ms and 10ms $\pm$ 3ms jitter. The zero latency condition was significantly rated more positively than the 10ms with jitter and 20ms latency conditions in six quality measures, emphasising the importance of not only low, but stable latency in digital musical instruments. There was no significant difference in rating between the zero latency condition and 10ms condition. A quantitative analysis of timing accuracy in a metronome task under latency conditions showed no significant difference in mean synchronisation error. This suggests that the 20ms and 10ms with jitter latency conditions degrade subjective impressions of an instrument, but without significantly affecting the timing performance of our participants. These findings are discussed in terms of control intimacy and instrument transparency.},

	abstract = {An algorithm is presented for the estimation of the fundamental frequency (F0) of speech or musical sounds. It is based on the well-known autocorrelation method with a number of modifications that combine to prevent errors. The algorithm has several desirable features. Error rates are about three times lower than the best competing methods, as evaluated over a database of speech recorded together with a laryngograph signal. There is no upper limit on the frequency search range, so the algorithm is suited for high-pitched voices and music. The algorithm is relatively simple and may be implemented efficiently and with low latency, and it involves few parameters that must be tuned. It is based on a signal model (periodic signal) that may be extended in several ways to handle various forms of aperiodicity that occur in particular applications. Finally, interesting parallels may be drawn with models of auditory processing.},

	abstract = {Many researchers have sought explanations for the purported tonal superiority of Old Italian violins by investigating varnish and wood properties, plate tuning systems, and the spectral balance of the radiated sound. Nevertheless, the fundamental premise of tonal superiority has been investigated scientifically only once very recently, and results showed a general preference for new violins and that players were unable to reliably distinguish new violins from old. The study was, however, relatively small in terms of the number of violins tested (six), the time allotted to each player (an hour), and the size of the test space (a hotel room). In this study, 10 renowned soloists each blind-tested six Old Italian violins (including five by Stradivari) and six new during two 75-min sessions---the first in a rehearsal room, the second in a 300-seat concert hall. When asked to choose a violin to replace their own for a hypothetical concert tour, 6 of the 10 soloists chose a new instrument. A single new violin was easily the most-preferred of the 12. On average, soloists rated their favorite new violins more highly than their favorite old for playability, articulation, and projection, and at least equal to old in terms of timbre. Soloists failed to distinguish new from old at better than chance levels. These results confirm and extend those of the earlier study and present a striking challenge to near-canonical beliefs about Old Italian violins.},

	abstract = {This Open Access book offers an original interdisciplinary overview of the role of haptic feedback in musical interaction. Divided into two parts, part I examines the tactile aspects of music performance and perception, discussing how they affect user experience and performance in terms of usability, functionality and perceived quality of musical instruments. Part II presents engineering, computational, and design approaches and guidelines that have been applied to render and exploit haptic feedback in digital musical interfaces. Musical Haptics introduces an emerging field that brings together engineering, human-computer interaction, applied psychology, musical aesthetics, and music performance. The latter, defined as the complex system of sensory-motor interactions between musicians and their instruments, presents a well-defined framework in which to study basic psychophysical, perceptual, and biomechanical aspects of touch, all of which will inform the design of haptic musical interfaces. Tactile and proprioceptive cues enable embodied interaction and inform sophisticated control strategies that allow skilled musicians to achieve high performance and expressivity. The use of haptic feedback in digital musical interfaces is expected to enhance user experience and performance, improve accessibility for disabled persons, and provide an effective means for musical tuition and guidance.},

	abstract = {Inverse methods have been used for decades to identify material properties, in parallel, or as a substitution for direct methods. Although it has proven a useful method for many types of materials and simple geometrical shapes, it has barely been used on complex shape parts. This is the main objective of the non-destructive method proposed in this study. The proposed inverse approach, based on both vibrational experiment data and Finite Element Model Updating (FEMU), is successfully applied to a violin soundboard made of flax-epoxy composite. Results show that, by minimizing the discrepancy between the experimental and numerical data, three rigidities and three loss factors can be determined simultaneously. The identified values of the constitutive elastic moduli and longitudinal loss factor are in agreement with those determined using quasi-static tests and dynamic mechanical analysis.},

	abstract = {*Evidence of the dominance of the guitar brace design over material and climatic variability.*Statistical methodology applied to musical instruments study.*Stochastic analysis based on physics-based models.*Fuzzy FRF for different cases of soundboard braces.
It is generally alleged that the design choices of acoustic guitar bracing patterns lead to a specific sound of the instrument. However, in the presence of strong uncertainties due to variability of material properties and climatic conditions, the robustness of the soundboard dynamics has yet to be investigated. In this study, three types of bracing patterns are studied using physics-based models and stochastic analyses are performed to account for material and climatic uncertainties. It is shown that the choice of a brace design leads, at least in the low frequency domain, to a dynamic behaviour that is not stackable with another design, even in the presence of strong aleatory uncertainties. This assessment supports the conjecture that guitar brace design choices have a greater impact than material variability where guitar soundboard dynamics are concerned. More generally, these results illustrate the usefulness of detailed physics-based models in the understanding, design and making of guitars.},

	abstract = {In this study, the influence of ``bear claw'' or indented growth ring anatomical patterns on the vibro-mechanical behavior of spruce wood have been investigated, particularly in the context of utilizing these singularities/specific features for the construction of violins. By employing vibrometry and modal analysis followed by finite element model updating, the vibro-mechanical properties (specific stiffness in longitudinal (L) and radial (R) directions and shear LR plane, and associated damping) of the indented growth rings spruce were identified and implemented in a numerical model of a violin. Results have revealed a significant increase in specific moduli in R direction and LR plane and decrease in L direction of spruce wood in the presence of indented growth rings, therefore accompanied by a reduction in anisotropic elastic properties, in comparison to spruce without these patterns. These properties led to changes in violin dynamics, globally increasing resonance frequencies and changing the shape of the vibration modes. The simulated frequency response function of the violin at the bridge suggested a global shift of the admittance of the bridge toward higher frequencies. These results suggest a potential impact of indented growth rings of spruce on the acoustic properties of instruments.},

@article{FritzClaudia2012Ppan,
	abstract = {Most violinists believe that instruments by Stradivari and Guarneri "del Gesu" are tonally superior to other violins---and to new violins in particular. Many mechanical and acoustical factors have been proposed to account for this superiority; however, the fundamental premise of tonal superiority has not yet been properly investigated. Player's judgments about a Stradivari's sound may be biased by the violin's extraordinary monetary value and historical importance, but no studies designed to preclude such biasing factors have yet been published. We asked 21 experienced violinists to compare violins by Stradivari and Guarneri del Gesu with high-quality new instruments. The resulting preferences were based on the violinists' individual experiences of playing the instruments under double-blind conditions in a room with relatively dry acoustics. We found that (i) the most-preferred violin was new; (ii) the least-preferred was by Stradivari; (iii) there was scant correlation between an instrument's age and monetary value and its perceived quality; and (iv) most players seemed unable to tell whether their most-preferred instrument was new or old. These results present a striking challenge to conventional wisdom. Differences in taste among individual players, along with differences in playing qualities among individual instruments, appear more important than any general differences between new and old violins. Rather than searching for the "secret" of Stradivari, future research might best focused on how violinists evaluate instruments, on which specific playing qualities are most important to them, and on how these qualities relate to measurable attributes of the instruments, whether old or new.},

	abstract = {Old Italian violins are routinely credited with playing qualities supposedly unobtainable in new instruments. These qualities include the ability to project their sound more effectively in a concert hall---despite seeming relatively quiet under the ear of the player---compared with new violins. Although researchers have long tried to explain the ``mystery'' of Stradivari's sound, it is only recently that studies have addressed the fundamental assumption of tonal superiority. Results from two studies show that, under blind conditions, experienced violinists tend to prefer playing new violins over Old Italians. Moreover, they are unable to tell new from old at better than chance levels. This study explores the relative merits of Stradivari and new violins from the perspective of listeners in a hall. Projection and preference are taken as the two broadest criteria by which listeners might meaningfully compare violins. Which violins are heard better, and which are preferred? In two separate experiments, three new violins were compared with three by Stradivari. Projection was tested both with and without orchestral accompaniment. Projection and preference were judged simultaneously by dividing listeners into two groups. Results are unambiguous. The new violins projected better than the Stradivaris whether tested with orchestra or without, the new violins were generally preferred by the listeners, and the listeners could not reliably distinguish new from old. The single best-projecting violin was considered the loudest under the ear by players, and on average, violins that were quieter under the ear were found to project less well.},

	abstract = {Asynchrony between tactile and auditory feedback (action-sound latency) when playing a musical instrument is widely recognized as disruptive to musical performance. In this paper we present a study that assesses the effects of delayed auditory feedback on the timing accuracy and judgments of instrument quality for two groups of participants: professional percussionists and non-percussionist amateur musicians. The amounts of delay tested in this study are relatively small in comparison to similar studies of auditory delays in a musical context (0 ms, 10 ms, 10 ms $\pm$ 3 ms, 20 ms). We found that both groups rated the zero latency condition as higher quality for a series of quality measures in comparison to 10 ms $\pm$ 3 ms and 20 ms latency, but did not show a significant difference in rating between 10 ms latency and zero latency. Professional percussionists were more aware of the latency conditions and showed less variation of timing under the latency conditions, although this ability decreased as the temporal demands of the task increased. We compare our findings from each group and discuss them in relation to latency in interactive digital systems more generally and experimentally similar work on sensorimotor control and rhythmic performance.},

	abstract = {On several acoustic and electromechanical keyboard instruments, the produced sound is not always strictly dependent exclusively on a discrete key velocity parameter, and minute gesture details can affect the final sonic result. By contrast, subtle variations in articulation have a relatively limited effect on the sound generation when the keyboard controller uses the MIDI standard, used in the vast majority of digital keyboards. In this paper we present an embedded platform that can generate sound in response to a controller capable of sensing the continuous position of keys on a keyboard. This platform enables the creation of keyboard-based DMIs which allow for a richer set of interaction gestures than would be possible through a MIDI keyboard, which we demonstrate through two example instruments. First, in a Hammond organ emulator, the sensing device allows to recreate the nuances of the interaction with the original instrument in a way a velocity-based MIDI controller could not. Second, a nonlinear waveguide flute synthesizer is shown as an example of the expressive capabilities that a continuous-keyboard controller opens up in the creation of new keyboard-based DMIs.},

	abstract = {Recording sounds from novel perspectives is of particular interest in the creation of immersive sound design. Sound design that provides an immersive experience for the listener is increasingly relevant, with widespread use across music, film, computer games and other media modalities. Laser doppler vibrometry (LDV) is a non-contact technique for the measurement of mechanical vibration. LDV is used in a wide range of research and engineering applications, including biophysics, microelectronics, and the automotive industries. In audio and acoustics research, LDV can be used instead of piezoelectric transducers where high sensitivity, non-contact measurements are important to ensure the accurate capture of vibrations over a wide frequency range. However, while its use for data gathering and analysis is very well established, its potential as a creative tool in immersive sound design has seen very little research. In this paper we show that LDV can provide a unique and creatively valuable sonic perspective on sound making objects. We demonstrate how an LDV system can be optimised for such use, and allow high quality vibration recordings to be made and used in the creation of immersive sound and music experiences. The results build on what is possible with commonly used piezoelectric transducers by harnessing the non-invasive nature of LDV. The ability to measure vibration at a single point with very wide spectral resolution, and to focus on the vibration of both large and tiny objects, reveals a new sonic world with significant potential in the development of immersive sound design.},

@article{AlmanzaVictor2023Psfa,
	abstract = {Curators of heritage musical instruments are faced with a number of recurring questions concerning the objects in their collection. Can the instrument be played without damaging it? How might it best be restored? Can we understand how and why the instrument evolved in the way it did and the impact of the different steps in its construction? Indeed, the impact of the different steps in the assembly of a musical instrument must be anticipated in order to assess its playability. Curators may question whether the state of internal stress, deliberately introduced by the instrument maker during the assembly process, should be restored after it has relaxed over time. These questions are typically answered through expert judgment. Meanwhile, it may be possible to leverage detailed physics-based models to enrich the decision support in the museum environment. This novel strategy is illustrated in the present study to investigate the importance of the different steps in the assembly process in order to guide the restoration process. In particular, numerical and experimental studies that have been carried out on a facsimile of the soundboard of the Christoph Koch's archlute of 1654 (E.546) with the objective of quantifying the impact of its assembly and gluing processes on the low frequency vibratory behavior. It is shown that a nominal non validated numerical model is able to predict trends, validated via experimental studies, that can be useful in understanding the impact of the assembly process in order to guide future restorative measures.

@article{CarcagnoSamuele2018Eobw,
	abstract = {Some of the most prized woods used for the backs and sides of acoustic guitars are expensive, rare, and from unsustainable sources. It is unclear to what extent back woods contribute to the sound and playability qualities of acoustic guitars. Six steel-string acoustic guitars were built for this study to the same design and material specifications except for the back/side plates which were made of woods varying widely in availability and price (Brazilian rosewood, Indian rosewood, mahogany, maple, sapele, and walnut). Bridge-admittance measurements revealed small differences between the modal properties of the guitars which could be largely attributed to residual manufacturing variability rather than to the back/side plates. Overall sound quality ratings, given by 52 guitarists in a dimly lit room while wearing welder's goggles to prevent visual identification, were very similar between the six guitars. The results of a blinded ABX discrimination test, performed by another subset of 31 guitarists, indicate that guitarists could not easily distinguish the guitars by their sound or feel. Overall, the results suggest that the species of wood used for the back and sides of a steel-string acoustic guitar has only a marginal impact on its body mode properties and perceived sound.},
